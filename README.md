# Battleship
Welcome to our new gem!

This gem implements the battleship gameplay by entering commands through the console

The gem was created as a task in the discipline "Programming paradigms and technologies" in order to get acquainted with the development of gems.
By itself, the gem represents the gameplay of a sea battle (according to Russian rules), where you play with a computer.
Commands are entered through the console, everything else depends on your luck.

(... there are possibly bug... in the sense feature)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'battleship'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install battleship

## Usage
Download the game, break into the ship battle, enter coordinates, arrange the ship yourself or use a random field. Show the machine that it can't compete with a human. Prove that you are the most worthy commander of the ship!

In order to learn how to use this gem, we advise you to study the 'rules' and 'help' commands before entering 'start'.
When entering coordinates, you can enter over to exit the game

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
